# Optimal Student
Numerical simulations of optimal student preferences and prior. Run main.py to recreate figures in the paper. plots.py has the functions to generate each plot and dynamics_functions.py has helper functions to perform numerical computations such as integrating the differential equation.

The environment.yml file can be used to recreate the anaconda environment that was used to generate the plots in the paper.
